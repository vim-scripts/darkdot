This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=573

This is a dark colorscheme that uses the colors found on http://slashdot.org. By this I mean that white, black and cyan are the most common colors, not that the programs will look like Slashdot postings.

It is a colorscheme both for the GUI and the console version of vim.

The latest version and a screenshot can be found at http://www.c7obs.net/~david/stuff/
